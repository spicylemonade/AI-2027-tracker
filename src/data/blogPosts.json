    "content": "This post explains our methodology for tracking and evaluating predictions from the AI 2027 scenario. We aim for transparency and objectivity in our assessment process.\n\n## Prediction Extraction & Categorization\n\nWe carefully extract concrete, falsifiable predictions from the scenario text. Each prediction is:\n- Categorized by topic (e.g., Compute, Agent Capabilities, Geopolitics)\n- Assigned to a specific timeline segment\n- Given a current status (e.g., Confirmed Accurate, Partially Accurate, Inaccurate, In Progress)\n- Scored for accuracy when sufficient evidence exists\n\n## Accuracy Scoring Rubric\n\nWe use a detailed rubric to ensure consistent evaluation across predictions. Scores range from 0-100% in 20% increments, based on four key criteria:\n- Core Event/Claim: Did the main event or claim occur?\n- Timing: Did it happen within the predicted timeframe?\n- Magnitude/Scale: Was the scale/impact as predicted?\n- Context/Nuance: Did surrounding circumstances align?\n\n### Detailed Scoring Framework\n\n| Score | Label | Criteria | Example |\n|-------|--------|----------|----------|\n| 100% | Confirmed Accurate | Perfect or near-perfect match across all criteria (event, timing, magnitude, context). Negligible deviations. | Predicted 10,000-person AI protest in DC in Late 2026; ~10,500 protested in Nov 2026 over AI job loss. |\n| 80% | Largely Accurate | Core event occurred as predicted. Timing accurate/very close. Magnitude and context mostly aligned with minor deviations. | Predicted Agent-1 release in Early 2026 with specific capabilities; released Feb 2026 with 90% of described capabilities. |\n| 60% | Partially Accurate - Medium | Core event largely occurred with reasonable timing, but magnitude/scale or context notably different. More alignments than discrepancies. | Predicted China would steal Agent-2 weights in Feb 2027. Instead, they stole Agent-1+ weights in April 2027. |\n| 40% | Partially Accurate - Low | Some elements materialized, but significant aspects didn't or were very different. Either timing way off but event similar, or timing right but event/impact very different. | Predicted 30% market growth led by AI, but growth was only 10% and AI played minor role. |\n| 20% | Largely Inaccurate | Only minor/tangential elements occurred. Core claim incorrect or drastically different. Timing, magnitude, context all significantly off. | Predicted widespread use of AI Agent X for task Y, but only tiny niche used very different Agent Z for vaguely related task. |\n| 0% | Inaccurate / Debunked | Core event/claim did not happen at all. Events directly contradict prediction. Fundamentally wrong premise/outcome. | Predicted company would release Model X, but company went bankrupt instead. |\n\n## Important Notes\n\n### Evidence Requirements\nAll evaluations must be based on verifiable evidence from credible sources:\n- News reports\n- Company announcements\n- Market data\n- Research papers\n- Other reliable public sources\n\n### Score Evolution\n- Scores may change as new information becomes available\n- Predictions marked \"In Progress\" are regularly re-evaluated\n- Some predictions may be too early to score (marked as \"Pending\" or \"Too Early to Tell\")\n\n### Handling Subjectivity\nWhile scoring inevitably involves some judgment, especially for qualitative predictions, we strive for consistency by:\n- Following the rubric criteria strictly\n- Documenting our reasoning\n- Linking to supporting evidence\n- Updating assessments when significant new information emerges\n",
