    "content": "This post explains our methodology for tracking and evaluating predictions from the AI 2027 scenario. We aim for transparency and objectivity in our assessment process.\n\n## Prediction Extraction & Categorization\n\nWe carefully extract concrete, falsifiable predictions from the scenario text. Each prediction is:\n- Categorized by topic (e.g., Compute, Agent Capabilities, Geopolitics)\n- Assigned to a specific timeline segment\n- Given a current status (e.g., Confirmed Accurate, Partially Accurate, Inaccurate, In Progress)\n- Scored for accuracy when sufficient evidence exists\n\n## Accuracy Scoring Rubric\n\nWe use a detailed rubric to ensure consistent evaluation across predictions. Scores range from 0-100% in 20% increments, based on four key criteria:\n- Core Event/Claim: Did the main event or claim occur?\n- Timing: Did it happen within the predicted timeframe?\n- Magnitude/Scale: Was the scale/impact as predicted?\n- Context/Nuance: Did surrounding circumstances align?\n\n### Detailed Scoring Framework\n\n| Score | Label | Criteria | Example |\n|-------|--------|----------|----------|\n| 100%  | Highly Accurate / Confirmed            | The prediction matched the observed reality with high fidelity across key criteria: core event, timing, magnitude/scale, and context/nuance. Any deviations are minor and do not detract from the prediction's overall correctness and insight.                                                                                                                               | Predicted a 10,000-person protest in DC in Late 2026 focused on AI job loss; a protest of ~10,500 occurred in Nov 2026 with that focus. |\n| 80%   | Largely Accurate / Directionally Strong | The core event/claim occurred in a clearly recognizable form, capturing the general direction or essence of the prediction well. This indicates significant foresight. However, there were noticeable deviations in either the specific timing (e.g., happened 6-12 months later/earlier) or the magnitude/scale/specific details (e.g., different specific actors involved, significantly smaller/larger scale, different but related technology version). The prediction was clearly insightful and more right than wrong, despite inaccuracies in specifics. | Predicted China steals Agent-2 weights in Feb 2027. Instead, they stole Agent-1+ weights in April 2027. (Core event type - state-level theft of advanced model - occurred, capturing the essence. Timing and specific agent version differ = 80%). |\n| 60%   | Partially Accurate / Mixed Results     | The prediction identified a relevant trend or event, but with significant inaccuracies in multiple key areas (e.g., both timing and magnitude were substantially off, or the core event happened but in a very different context or with different key players than predicted). While not entirely wrong, the prediction had substantial flaws that limit its overall accuracy and insightfulness.                                  | Predicted widespread consumer adoption of Agent X by Mid-2025 costing $100/month. Some niche adoption occurred by Late 2026 costing $500/month, but it wasn't widespread. (Trend related, but timing, scale, and cost were all significantly off). |\n| 40%   | Partially Inaccurate / Weakly Related  | Some elements occurred, but major aspects did not, or were substantially different in nature. The core event might be vaguely related, but timing, magnitude, and context were all significantly off. OR, the prediction captured a minor related event but missed the main predicted phenomenon entirely. The directional insight was weak or misleading.                                                | Predicted 30% market growth driven primarily by AI; growth was 5%, driven by unrelated factors, with AI having negligible impact. |\n| 20%   | Largely Inaccurate                     | Only a very minor, tangential, or superficial element of the prediction occurred. The core event/claim was incorrect, and the timing, magnitude, and context were significantly off. The prediction failed to capture the essence of what happened.                                                                                                                                                  | Predicted specific AI regulation Y passes; completely different regulation Z with opposite goals passes instead. |\n| 0%    | Inaccurate / Debunked                  | The core event or claim did not happen. Events directly and fundamentally contradict the prediction. The prediction was wrong in its basic premise or outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Predicted Company X dominates AI; Company X went bankrupt. |\n\n## Important Notes\n\n### Evidence Requirements\nAll evaluations must be based on verifiable evidence from credible sources:\n- News reports\n- Company announcements\n- Market data\n- Research papers\n- Other reliable public sources\n\n### Score Evolution\n- Scores may change as new information becomes available\n- Predictions marked \"In Progress\" are regularly re-evaluated\n- Some predictions may be too early to score (marked as \"Pending\" or \"Too Early to Tell\")\n\n### Handling Subjectivity\nWhile scoring inevitably involves some judgment, especially for qualitative predictions, we strive for consistency by:\n- Following the rubric criteria strictly\n- Documenting our reasoning\n- Linking to supporting evidence\n- Updating assessments when significant new information emerges\n",
